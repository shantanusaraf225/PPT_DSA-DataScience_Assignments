During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neural network units to zero, effectively \"dropping out\" those units. This prevents overreliance on specific units and encourages the network to learn more robust and generalized representations. Dropout regularization helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data."
